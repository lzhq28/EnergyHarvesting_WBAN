Wireless body area network (WBAN) has become a promising network for continuous health monitoring of various diseases. 
The limited energy of sensors in WBAN cannot support the long term work with the high requirements of Quality of Service (QoS) for health applications. 
Energy harvesting (EH)-powered WBAN, which can provide uninterrupted work, has attracted more attention from both macadamia and industry. 
However, the time-varying and heterogeneous EH states of different sensors  become an important factor when designing the resource allocation schemes in EH-powered WBAN.
In this paper, we propose a novel two-phase resource allocation scheme, which optimizes the allocation of transmission power, source rate and slots to improve the QoS performance of EH-powered WBAN. In the first phase, we analysis the relationship between the QoS performance and the source rate for satisfying the Energy Neutral Operation (ENO), and then a joint Power-Rate Control Scheme (PRCS) is proposed to optimize the source rate and transmission power for ensuring the long-term QoS performance based on the statistical properties of EH. 
Moreover, we design a QoS Aware Slot Allocation Scheme (QASAS) to dynamically adjust the time slot allocation to cope with the time-varying and heterogeneous EH states for obtaining better short-term QoS performance in the second phase.
Finally, numerical simulation results demonstrate that the proposed joint the Power-Rate-Slot resource allocation scheme of EH-powered WBAN can effectively exploit the time-varying EH to improve both long-term and short-term QoS performance.

\section{Introduction}
With the rapid development of sensor and wireless communication technologies, wireless body area network (WBAN) can replace complex and wired healthcare requirement to continuously monitor the body's vital signals and provide real-time feedback to the user and doctors without causing any discomfort and interrupting their daily lifestyle \cite{salayma2017wireless,movassaghi2014wireless,dagdeviren2017energy}. 
WBAN typically consists of several lower-power, miniaturized and lightweight on-body or implanted sensor nodes to monitor physiological parameters, which are collected and further transmitted to remote medical servers by one energy-efficient hub (Mobile phone or PDA) for various medical and healthcare applications \cite{zhang2017medium}. 
Generally, most of these applications are life critical and require a long lifetime without interrupting user's daily lifestyle, while still have a strict guarantee of Quality of Service (QoS) in terms of packet loss, delay and so on \cite{razzaque2017qos}.

However, the limited battery capacity, constrained by the size and weight of sensors nodes, cannot support the long term operation without interruption.  Besides, replacing battery or taking off sensors to charge power is not always practical especially for some implanted sensors, which also causes the interruption of the health monitoring system \cite{ibarra2016qos,luo2017resource}. Although the classical energy saving technologies make efforts to explore different energy efficient schemes in aspects of MAC protocol design, power control schemes and cross-layer resource scheduling strategies to prolong the system lifetime \cite{zhang2017medium,zang2016accelerometer,liu2017transmission}, the ultimate goal 'uninterrupted work' cannot be ensured. 
Fortunately, Energy Harvesting (EH) technology, which can collect energy from various sources around human body, has recently been considered as a promising solution to overcome the bottleneck of energy limited WBANs \cite{hao2017energy}. For instance, EH-powered sensors can scavenge energy from a variety of limitless ambient sources (e.g., light, heat, electromagnetic radiation) or the body itself (e.g., locomotion, breathing, heartbeat, lactate), and then convert it to usable electric energy for providing continuous power \cite{akhtar2017energy}. Thus, EH-powered WBANs have the potential ability to achieve infinite lifetime and perpetual operation, which is called Energy Neutral Operation (ENO) \cite{kansal2007power}.
Furthermore, sensors can also combine several types of EH sources for acquiring more energy to support more strict QoS requirements \cite{ibarra2016qos}.
Therefore, researchers pay more and more attentions on how to keep in ENO state with considering the QoS performance in EH-powered WBAN.

Due to the limitation of the sensor size, the energy harvester cannot always satisfy the ENO requirement and the collected energy is scarce. In addition, sensors in different positions on the body may have different types of EH and the energy collection rates are heterogeneous. Meanwhile, harvesters with energy sources from the human body have time-varying states caused by the dynamic body movement status. Thus, the time-varying and heterogeneous EH states become a significant factor to design the effective resource allocation scheme for ENO state. 
Therefore, it is highly meaningful to do some resource management researches on EH-powered WBAN with considering the QoS performance.


\subsection{Related works}

Compared with EH-powered wireless sensor networks (WSNs), the human body contains more bio-energy sources  besides the ambient source for various kinds of energy harvesters in WBANs \cite{leng2017resource}. Generally, these bio-energy sources can be classified into biochemical and biomechnical energy sources. The biochemical energy sources convert electrochemical reactions to electricity for implanted body sensors, while the harvesters can scavenge energy from the voluntary and involuntary actions of the human body as biomechnical energy sources \cite{akhtar2017energy}. The scavenged energy can be converted to  electric potential by appropriated harvesters, and then stored into a rechargeable battery or a super-capacitor for powering up wireless body sensors \cite{wahbah2014characterization}. The energy harvesting efficiency can be improved to harvest more energy through the elaborate hardware circuit design \cite{xia20140}\cite{el201610}. Therefore, the available power density by harvesting energy from human body gradually reaches $\mu W$ range, which will be able to run low-low-power-consuming wireless devices, such as Bluetooth4.0 \cite{bluetooth2010}, MicaZ \cite{kramer2006energy}, MultiMode \cite{wong20131} and so on. However, the harvesting process of human body sensors is unstable and time-varying due to the dynamic body movement status \cite{hao2017energy}. In addition, the different positions of sensors or different types of energy harvesters have heterogeneous energy harvesting rates. Therefore, the resource allocation scheme for EH-powered WBAN should be able to cope with time-varying and heterogeneous EH states for better utilizing the scavenged energy.

In the literature, some researches have been focused on the resource allocation schemes for EH-powered WBANs. Generally, these resource allocations schemes can be divided into two categories in terms of the priori knowledge of the channel state, data state and energy state for the transmitter, i. e. the offline schemes \cite{mosavat2017maximizing,varan2016delay,shan2015discrete,tutuncuoglu2012optimum,wei2015power,huang2014optimal} and the online schemes \cite{leng2017resource,ibarra2016qos,alhawari2016power,dionisi2016autonomous,shaviv2016universally,liu2015optimal,ozel2011transmission}. 
For the offline schemes, it is assumed that the transmitter have perfect priori knowledge of the channel state, data state and the energy state when it allocates resources. 
In \cite{tutuncuoglu2012optimum}, the short-term throughput and the transmission completion time were regarded as the objective function to obtain the optimum power allocation with a deadline constraint and finite energy storage capacity, while energy arrivals were assumed as a priori known. 
Shan et al. \cite{shan2015discrete} proposed a general framework to transform the continuous-rate model into practical discrete transmission rates with keeping the optimality, and the per-application quality-of-service (QoS) could be guaranteed by the optimal rate scheduling algorithm for an EH enabled transmitter, assuming that the information regarding packets and harvesting is known in advance. 
Varan et al., \cite{varan2016delay} considered the throughput maximization problem with finite energy and data storage constraints, and new notions of water pumps and overflow bins were added to the directional waterfilling for solving the energy scheduling problem.  
In addition, the weighted sum of the outage probabilities was the objective function to minimize in the power control policy, while the harvested energy was known as a priori to the scheduler \cite{wei2015power,huang2014optimal}. However, due to the non-convex objective function, a near-optimal offline scheme was designed with only high signal-to-noise ratios.
The above offline resource allocation schemes commonly construct the convex optimization problems and analytical solutions to obtain the optimal resource allocation results with perfect non-causal and priori knowledge. Thus, offline schemes can only serve as a benchmark of the resource allocation schemes, or the EH states are predictable for some stable energy sources.   

Compared with the offline schemes, only the causal information and statistical knowledge of energy states, data states and channel states can be utilized in the online schemes to manage the data packets and the collected energy. 
% online 思路：由长用方法-》逐渐引入：多个节点+长期和短期QoS服务问题
Ozel et al., \cite{ozel2011transmission} maximized the number of bits sent by a deadline given only the distributions of the energy arrivals and channel fade levels. 
Leng and Yener \cite{leng2017resource} maximized the long-term expected throughput under the energy constraints, and the close-form expression of optimal transmission power was obtained by formulating the Largrangian and solving the KKT conditions.
However, these long-term throughput cannot meet the specific application requirements for these heterogeneous body sensors in WBANs. In addition, the QoS requirements are not carefully taken into consideration in the optimization problems.
Liu et al., \cite{liu2015optimal} modeled the transmission power and time allocation optimization problem as a Markov decision process (MDP) to provide a sustainable and high quality service for EH-powered WBAN. 
However, MDP based resource allocation schemes have the high complexity for wireless devices with limited computational capabilities in WBANs, and they are highly dependent on the accuracy models of channel fading level, energy arrivals and data arrivals, which are hardly obtained in practice. 
To achieve the best possible QoS, authors of \cite{ibarra2016qos} proposed a joint power-QoS control scheme for making optimal use of harvested energy to efficiently transmit the respective data packets of only one sensor in WBAN. However, the channel fading was not considered in the scheme, which could not deal with the dynamic link characteristics in WBANs. In addition, the time-varying and heterogeneous EH states of different body sensors were not considered.

\subsection{Contributions}
In this paper, we develop an efficient resource allocation scheme for EH-powered WBANs to support both the long-term and short-term QoS requirements, when the energy harvesting states of different body sensors are heterogeneous and time-varying. The important contributions of this paper are expressed as three aspects:
 \begin{enumerate}
	 \item As far as we know, this work is the first to joint the transmission power, source rate and time slots to effectively allocate the resources under dynamic link characteristics of heterogeneous body sensors with the time-varying EH states. Therefore, the harvested energy can be efficiently utilized to improving both the long-term and short-term QoS performances.
	 \item We analyze the relationship between the source rate and the long-term QoS performance of a body sensor for satisfying the Energy Neutral Operation (ENO). Then, we optimize the transmission power and the source rates for different body sensors to improve the long-term QoS performance, which is based on the statistical knowledge of energy harvesting and channel fading. An optimal numerical solution is successfully obtained through the transformation of the non-convex problem.
	\item The time-varying and heterogeneous EH states will cause the fluctuation of the data queues, which affect the short-term QoS performance. Thus, we carefully predict the states of each sensors based on the energy states and queue states, and then dynamically adjust the time slot allocation to better transmit data packets with harvesting energy for improving the short-term QoS performance.
 \end{enumerate}

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. 
In Section \ref{sec:system_model}, the system model is presented. In Section \ref{sec:PRCS}, the relationship between the source rate and the QoS peformance is described in details, and a join power and source rate optimization allocation problem is formulated and solved. 
In Section \ref{sec:QASAS}, the sensor states are evaluated based on the energy state and queue buffer state, and a short-term QoS aware slot allocation scheme is provided in details.
In Section \ref{sec:simulation}, the numerical results are discussed and analyzed. Finally, Section \ref{sec:conclusion} concludes the paper.


\section{System model} \label{sec:system_model}
In this section, we give the details of node's architecture and WBAN topology in EH-based WBAN. Then, the energy harvesting model is introduced. Finally, the energy consumption model is correspondingly obtained with the dynamic link characteristics.

\subsection{Node's Architecture and WBAN Topology}
We consider a classical WBAN which consists of one hub and $N$ EH-powered wireless sensor nodes. 
Suppose that the hub (such as PDA and mobile phone) has sufficient resources to implement some resource allocation scheme with high computation complexity, and the wireless sensor nodes placed in different positions of the body have limited processing and storage resources with energy harvesters. The set of body sensor nodes is expressed as $\mathcal{C}_{node}=\left\{1,2,\cdots,N \right\}$. As recommended by IEEE 802.15.6 \cite{ieee2012WBAN}, the body sensor nodes collect the vital signals and communicate directly with the hub considering the constrained resources of sensor nodes in a star topology. In addition, a scheduled access mechanism in beacon mode with superframe boundaries is adopted to access the channel without collisions, idle listening and overhearing of sensor nodes for saving scarce energy. One superframe is formed by one beacon and $M$ slots, and the set of slots are expressed as $\mathcal{C}_{slot}=\left\{1,2,...,M\right\}$. In the beacon of superframe, the hub broadcast the beacon packets to configure the transmission rates, source rates and dedicate time slots for each nodes. And the nodes only turn active in its dedicate time slots to transmit data signals, and turn sleep in other slots for saving energy. In each node, the vital signals are collected and packetized in the data queue, which will be transmitted to the hub with the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) queue strategy and the retransmission strategy \cite{liu2017buffer}. Thus, the packet losses only occur in two situations: data queue overflow and the delay over the preset threshold. 

\subsection{Energy Harvesting Model}

\begin{figure}[!htb]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.3\textwidth]{markov_model}
\caption{Discrete Two-state Markov Chain of the EH process}
\label{fig:markov_model}
\end{figure}
Due to the different positions and functions of different sensor nodes, the adopted energy harvesters may collect energy from different energy sources. 
For instance, the sensor node on the foot can utilize the piezoelectric transducer to harvest energy from the body motion \cite{geisler2017human}, and the sensor node for capturing the electrocardiograph (ECG) signal may use a thermoelectric generator to harvest from the body temperature \cite{thielen2017human}. Therefore, the EH states of different nodes are heterogeneous. In this paper, the harvested energy is stored in a rechargeable battery or a super-capacitor, then used to power the body sensor node \cite{akhtar2017energy}. 
The EH process of each node can be model as a correlated discrete-time Markov chain with two state: the active state (ON) and the inactive state (OFF) \cite{seyedi2010energy,ibarra2016qos}. And the coherence time of the EH process is set to the $t_{cor}=k \cdot  t_{slot}$, where $t_{slot}$ is the time length of one time slot in superframe. 
In the ON state, the energy acquisition rate follows an uniform distribution in range of $[EH_{min}, EH_{max}]$, which is based on intensity of body movement. In addition, the energy acquisition rate in the ON state are different for different sensor nodes. In the OFF state, the energy harvester does not collect any energy. The Markov chain of EH process is shown in Fig. \ref{fig:markov_model}. $p_{01}$ means the transition probability from OFF state to ON state, while $p_{10}$ represents the transition probability from ON state to OFF state. The probability of keeping ON state and OFF state are regarded as $p_{11}=1-p_{10}$ and $p_{00}=1-p_{01}$, respectively. And the steady probabilities of ON state and OFF state are expressed as follows, 
\begin{equation}
{\mu _{on}} = {{{p_{01}}} \over {{p_{01}} + {p_{10}}}}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
{\mu _{off}} = {{{p_{10}}} \over {{p_{01}} + {p_{10}}}}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Energy Consumption Model}
In body sensor nodes, most of the energy is consumed to transmit data packets and recieve ACK packets, while the energy consumption of the processing and beacon listening can be ignored  \cite{xiao2009transmission}. Generally, the transmission energy consumption consists of two parts: the transmit amplifier energy consumption $E_{tx}$ and the circuitry energy consumption $E_{ct}$ \cite{he2011optimal,liu2017buffer}. Thus, the energy model of transmitting packets can be expressed as follows,
\begin{equation}
E_{tran} = \left( {1 + \alpha } \right){E_{tx}} + {E_{ct}}
\end{equation}
Compared with the energy consumption of transmitting packets, the energy model of receiving packets only contains the circuitry energy consumption $E_{ct}$.
\begin{equation}
E_{rec} = {E_{ct}}
\end{equation}
where $\alpha$ means the power amplifier inefficiency factor, $E_{tx}=P_{tx}t$ and $E_{ct}=P_{ct}t$. $P_{tx}$ represents the transmission power of the transmitter, and $P_{ct}$ is the circuitry power, which is a constant depending on the specific transmitter \cite{lin2009asymmetric}. 

To improve the QoS requirements，the transmission power should be dynamically adjusted to cope with the time-varying link quality. Thus, the path loss model of wireless links become a important factor for the energy consumption. In this paper, the path loss model $PL\left( d \right)$ for both Light-Of-Sight (LOS) and None-Light-Of-Sight (NLOS) scenarios follows the log normal distribution as recommended by IEEE 802.15.6 \cite{ieee2012WBAN}.
\begin{equation}\label{eq:PL}
\small{
PL\left( d \right) ={PL_{d_0}} + 10n{\log _{10}}\left( {\frac{d}{{{d_0}}}} \right) + {X_\sigma }
}
\end{equation}
where $PL_{d_0}$ is the path loss at the referent distance $d_0$, and $n$ represents the path-loss exponent. The shadowing $X_\sigma$ follows the normal distribution $\mathcal{N}\left( {\mu_{s},\sigma_{s}^2 } \right)$, and the statistic characteristics are related to the human postures and the environments \cite{reusens2009characterization}\cite{d2010statistical}. 

\section{Long-term Power-Rate Control Scheme} \label{sec:PRCS}
In this section, the analysis of the relationship between the source rate and the QoS performance is first given in details. Then, the join power and source rate optimal allocation are formulated as a optimization problem. Finally, the optimal numerical solution is given through the convex transformation.
\subsection{Relationship between Source Rate and QoS performance}
%% 应该需要解释一下为什么要调节数据源速率，尤其是降低采样速率：1）保持数据完整性；2）使用rate-distortion 压缩算法
As we known, the higher the source rate is, the more energy it needs to be transmitted. When the harvested energy cannot support the current source rate, the packet loss rate of packets will occur. Conversely, the energy will accumulate with the . 
Thus, the source rate should be dynamically adjusted to the statistic feature of EH process for satisfying the Energy Neutral Operation (ENO). 
We have three cases on the relationship between the source rate and the QoS performance:

\textbf{Case 1:} When the harvester with minimum energy acquisition rate $EH_{\min}$ in the ON state still can collect enough energy to transmit the packets in a long term, it means the perfect QoS performance can be obtained under the Energy Neutral Operation (NEO).
\begin{equation}
0 < \left[ {\left( {1 + \alpha } \right){P_{tx}} + {P_{ct}}} \right] \cdot {{S \cdot T} \over R} \le {\mu _{on}} \cdot {EH_{\min }} \cdot T \\
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\Rightarrow {\rm{   }}0 < S \le {{{\mu _{on}} \cdot {EH_{\min }} \cdot R} \over {\left[ {\left( {1 + \alpha } \right){P_{tx}} + {P_{ct}}} \right]}}
\end{equation}
where $R$ is the transmission rate, and $T$ is the time length of one superframe. If the above inequality can be satisfied, the collected energy is enough to transmit all packets in a long term. Thus, the QoS performance of packets can be guaranteed through the effective resource allocation scheme.

\textbf{Case 2:} When the required energy harvesting rate for the source rate is in range of $[EH_{min}, EH_{max}]$ of the ON state, it means the packet losses may occur due to the time-varying EH states.
\begin{equation} \footnotesize 
{\mu _{on}} \cdot {EH_{\min }} \cdot T < \left[ {\left( {1 + \alpha } \right){P_{tx}} + {P_{ct}}} \right] \cdot {{S \cdot T} \over R} \le {\mu _{on}} \cdot {EH_{\max }} \cdot T
\end{equation}
\begin{equation} \footnotesize
\Rightarrow {{{\mu _{on}} \cdot {EH_{\min }} \cdot R} \over {\left[ {\left( {1 + \alpha } \right){P_{tx}} + {P_{ct}}} \right]}} < S \le {{{\mu _{on}} \cdot {EH_{\max}} \cdot R} \over {\left[ {\left( {1 + \alpha } \right){P_{tx}} + {P_{ct}}} \right]}}
\end{equation}

If the source rate satisfies the above inequality, there may be some packets blocked in the data queue. The blocked packets need to be dealt with carefully in the resource allocation scheme, otherwise the short-term QoS performance will become worse.

\textbf{Case 3:} When the maximum energy acquisition rate $EH_{\max}$ cannot support the source rate, it means the packet losses are sure to appear due to the insufficient energy.
\begin{equation} 
{\mu _{on}} \cdot {EH_{\max }} \cdot T < \left[ {\left( {1 + \alpha } \right){P_{tx}} + {P_{ct}}} \right] \cdot {{S \cdot T} \over R}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation} 
  \Rightarrow {\rm{   }}{{{\mu _{on}} \cdot {EH_{\max }} \cdot R} \over {\left[ {\left( {1 + \alpha } \right){P_{tx}} + {P_{ct}}} \right]}} < S 
\end{equation}

If the source rate satisfies the above inequality, there must be some packets blocked in the data queue. 
The resource allocation scheme needs to carefully schedule resources to improve the QoS performance.
\subsection{Join Power and Source Rate Optimal Allocation Problem}
With the statistic knowledge of the EH process, the achievable source rate in the dynamic link characteristics should be obtained to better configure the final source rate with little distortion for effective diagnostic, while the long-term QoS constraints are also fully taken into consideration. 
In the resource allocation scheme, the packet loss rate (PLR) as the main QoS metrics is studied. The PLR can be expressed as the function of the bit Signal to Noise Ratio (bit SNR),
\begin{equation}
PLR({\gamma }) = 1 - {\left( {1 - {P_{b,B}}({\gamma })} \right)^L}
\end{equation}
where bit SNR can be calculated as ${\gamma } =  {10^{\frac{{{P_{tx,dB}} - PL\left( d \right) - {P_{N}}}}{{10}}}} \frac{B}{R}$. $L$ is the length of a packet in bits. $P_{tx,dB}$ is the transmission power in dB. $P_{N}$ is the power of noise. $B$ represents the system bandwidth. $P_{b,B}$ indicates the equivalent bit error rate based on the modulation and the channel coding \cite{goldsmith2005wireless}. 

Considering the dynamic link quality, the average packet loss rate are calculated as a long-term QoS constraint.
\begin{equation} \footnotesize
\overline{PLR}  = \int\limits_0^{ + \infty } {PLR({\gamma})} P({\gamma}|{\mu _{{\gamma _{dB}}}},{\sigma _{{\gamma _{dB}}}})d{\gamma }
\end{equation}
where $P({\gamma}|{\mu _{{\gamma _{dB}}}},{\sigma _{{\gamma _{dB}}}})$ represents the probability density function of bit SNR $\gamma$, and it follows a log-normal distribution as the shadowing $X_{\sigma}$. $\mu _{{\gamma _{dB}}}$ and ${\sigma _{{\gamma _{dB}}}}$ are the mean and the standard deviation of $\gamma$ in dB, respectively. Finally, the PLR constraint can be expressed as follows,
\begin{equation}  \small
\overline{PLR} < PLR_{th}
\end{equation}
where $PLR_{th}$ is the preset threshold of the packets loss rate.

In this paper, we investigates the allocation of the source rate and the transmission power under the constraints of the QoS performances by constructing the following join power and source rate optimization problem:
\begin{subequations}\label{P1:PRCS} \small
\begin{align}
    \textbf{P1:}& \qquad\mathop {\max }\limits_{\small{({P_{tx,i},{S_i}})}} \; {\sum\limits_{i = 1}^{i \in {\cal N}} {{S_i}} } , \label{P1:obj} \\
    s.t.\quad &{\sum\limits_{i = 1}^{i \in {\cal N}} {{S_i}}  \cdot T \le R \cdot T}, \label{P1:con1} \\
		& {\rm{0}} \le {{{S_i}} \over {1 - PL{R_{i,th}}}},\label{P1:con2}\\
    & {{{S_i}} \over {1 - PL{R_{i,th}}}} \le {{{{\mu _{on}} \cdot R \cdot \overline{EH_{i}} } \over {\left[ {\left( {1 + \alpha } \right){P_{tx,i}} + {P_{ct,i}}} \right]}}},\label{P1:con3}\\
    & {\overline {PL{R_i}}  \le PL{R_{i,th}}},\label{P1:con4}\\
    & {{P_{tx,\min }} \le {P_{tx,i}} \le {P_{tx,\max }}}, \label{P1:con5}
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
where $PLR_{i,th}$ is the threshold of the packet loss rate for node $i$.
$\overline{EH_{i}} ={{{\left( {E{H_{i,\max }} + E{H_{i,\min }}} \right)} \mathord{\left/
 {\vphantom {{\left( {E{H_{i,\max }} + E{H_{i,\min }}} \right)} {\rm{2}}}} \right.
 \kern-\nulldelimiterspace} {\rm{2}}}}$ is the mean of the energy harvesting rate for node $i$.
 $\overline {PL{R_i}}$ represents the average packet loss rate with the allocation transmission power $P_{i}$. $P_{tx,min}$ and $P_{tx,max}$ are the minimum value and the maximum value of the transmission power for the transmitter, and we assume all the nodes have the same type transmitter for the sake of simplicity.

With respect to \textbf{P1}, the objective function (\ref{P1:obj}) is to maximize the total of source rates under the QoS constraints. With the larger source rate, more useful information can be used for diagnosis.
The constraint (\ref{P1:con1}) means the total of source rates cannot be larger than the throughput with the transmission rate, otherwise a part of vital data signals will be discarded due to the limitation of the throughput. constraints (\ref{P1:con2}) and (\ref{P1:con3}) represent the equivalent source rate with considering PLR should be lower than the long-term achievable throughput with the harvested energy. Equation (\ref{P1:con4}) denotes the PLR constraint, and equation (\ref{P1:con5}) means the constraint of the transmission power. 

\subsection{Optimal Numerical Solution}

The above optimization problem \textbf{P1} is a nonlinear and non-convex problem, and it is difficult to solve. Fortunately, we find that the optimization problem \textbf{P1} is quit similar to the form of the Geometric Program (GP), which can be solved efficiently and reliably \cite{boyd2004convex}. Thus, we try to transform the problem \textbf{P1} into the form of the Geometric Program (GP).

Obviously, the objective function (\ref{P1:obj}) is a posynomial function. And all constraints, expect (\ref{P1:con3}) and (\ref{P1:con4}), can be easily converted to the form of a posynomial less than or equal to one. Fortunately, both constraints (\ref{P1:con3}) and (\ref{P1:con4}) can be successfully transformed into the form of posynomial inequalities through the following methods.

Firstly, the PLR constraint (\ref{P1:con4}) has not an analytical expression, but we have proved that the average PLR constraint is the monotone function of bit SNR in \cite{liu2017transmission}. Therefore, the PLR constraint can be equivalent to the following expression.
\begin{equation}
{\mu _{{\gamma _{dB}}}} \ge \mu_{th}
\end{equation}
where $\mu_{th}$ just satisfies the equation \resizebox{0.3\hsize}{!}{$\overline {PLR\left( {{\mu _{{th}}}} \right)}=PLR_{th}$}. And ${\mu _{{\gamma _{dB}}}}= E\left[ {10{{\log }_{10}}\left( {\frac{B}{R}} \right) + {P_{tx,dB}} - {PL\left( d \right)}- {P_{N}}} \right]$. Then, the equivalent PLR constraint can be expressed as follows,
\begin{equation} 
\begin{split}
P_{tx}{R^{{ - 1}}} & \ge {B^{ - 1}} {10^{\frac{{\mu _{th}+ {PL_{d_0}} + 10n{\log _{10}}\left( {\frac{d}{{{d_0}}}} \right)  + {P_{N}}}}{{10}}}} = {\theta _{th}}
\end{split}
\end{equation} 

Then, we define a new intermediate variable ${v_i} = {1 \over { {\left( {1 + \alpha } \right){P_{tx,i}} + {P_{ct,i}}} }}$. The optimization problem \textbf{P1} is finally transformed to the form of the Geometric Program (GP), as shown in follows,

\begin{subequations}\label{P2:PRCS} \small
\begin{align}
    \textbf{P2:}& \qquad\mathop {\max }\limits_{\small{({P_{tx,i},{v_i}})}} \; {\sum\limits_{i = 1}^{i \in {\cal N}} {{S_i}} } , \label{P2:obj} \\
    s.t.\quad &{\sum\limits_{i = 1}^{i \in {\cal N}} {{S_i}}  \cdot T \le R \cdot T}, \label{P2:con1} \\
		& {\rm{0}} \le {{{S_i}} \over {1 - PL{R_{i,th}}}},\label{P2:con2}\\
    & {{{{S_i} \cdot v_i^{ - 1}} \over {1 - PL{R_{i,th}}}} \le {\mu _{on}} \cdot R \cdot \overline{EH_{i}} },\label{P2:con3}\\
    & {{v_i} \le {1 \over {{P_{ct,i}} + \left( {1 + \alpha } \right) \cdot {\theta _{th}} \cdot R}}},\label{P2:con4}\\
    & {1 \over {\left( {1 + \alpha } \right) \cdot {P_{tx,\max }} + {P_{ct,i}}}}  \le {v_i} , \label{P2:con5} \\
		& {v_i} \le {1 \over {\left( {1 + \alpha } \right) \cdot {P_{tx,\min }} + {P_{ct,i}}}}, \label{P2:con5}
\end{align}
\end{subequations}

\subsection{Source Rate Configuration}
For vital signals, the larger source rate means more useful information can be used for diagnosis, meanwhile the larger source rate will cost more energy to be transmitted. However, the limited energy and dynamic link quality will result in many packet losses with an exorbitant source rate, and the random packet losses will break the integrity of data. Therefore, the source rate usually has a most appropriate upper boundary $S_{up}$ of the source rate, which contains enough information for diagnosis.
In addition, the source rate also have a acceptable low boundary $S_{low}$. When the source rate is lower than the low boundary $S_{low}$, the vital data will lose the diagnostic significance. Thus, the source rate will be re-configured as the following equation.
\begin{equation}
S_{i} = \max \left\{ \min (S_{i}, S_{up} ), S_{i,low} \right\}
\end{equation}

When the achievable source rate obtained by the optimization problem \textbf{P2} is larger than the upper boundary $S_{up}$, the source rate will be set to the upper boundary $S_{up}$ for saving harvested energy. When the achievable source rate is smaller than the lower boundary $S_{low}$, the source rate will be set to the lower boundary $S_{low}$ for maintaining the diagnostic significance. Otherwise, the source rate will keep the achievable source rate. 

\section{Short-term QoS Aware Slot Allocation Scheme} \label{sec:QASAS}
In the above section, the long-term QoS performance is considered with the time-varying EH states from statistical analysis. However, the time-varying EH states and dynamic link quality may cause the fluctuations of the data queue. In this section, we explore the time slot allocation to further improve the short-term QoS performance. Firstly, we analyze the energy harvesting process in details. Then, the sensor state evaluation method is given. Finally, the different slot allocation schemes are adopted for nodes with different states.

\subsection{Energy Harvesting Process Analysis}

As we adopt the scheduled access mechanism in beacon mode with superframe boundaries, nodes only turn active in its dedicated slots to transmit the data packets while keep sleep for saving energy in other slots. 
Considering the time-varying EH state and the fluctuation of the data queue, not only the number but also the location of slots should be carefully allocated for improving the short-term QoS performance. For instance, if the allocated slots for one node is at the end of the next superframe, more energy will be harvested for transmitting the blocked packets in the data queue.
Unfortunately, the hub can only know the EH states of nodes in the allocated slots of last superframe. In this paper, we will predict the EH states for each sensor in the following superframe.

The energy harvesting process is model as a two-state Markov chain as shown in Fig. \ref{fig:markov_model}. The transition matrix can be expressed as follows,
\begin{equation}
{\rm \textbf{P}} = \left[ {
\begin{matrix}
   {1 - {p_{01}}} & {{p_{01}}}  \cr 
   {{p_{10}}} & {1 - {p_{10}}}  \cr 
\end{matrix} 
 } \right]
\end{equation}

We define the probability of EH state to be in the ON state in a $x$-th slot is denoted by $p(x)$, then after $\tau$ slots, the EH state has been transferred ${\left\lceil\frac{\tau}{k}\right\rceil}$ times. ${\lceil \cdot \rceil}$ is the ceiling function.
Thus, the probability of the ON state after $\tau$ slots can be calculated as follows \cite{tselishchev2011reducing},
\begin{equation} \footnotesize \label{eq:P_ON_1}
\begin{split}
p(x+\tau) &= \left[\begin{matrix}
		1 - p(k) & p(k)
  \end{matrix}\right] 
	\cdot \textbf{P}^{\left\lceil\frac{\tau}{k}\right\rceil} \cdot
	\left[\begin{matrix}
		0\\
		1
  \end{matrix}\right]  \\
  &= {{{p_{01}}} \over Q}+ {{p\left( k \right) \cdot {p_{10}} - \left( {{\rm{1}} - p\left( k \right)} \right) \cdot {p_{01}}} \over Q} \cdot {\left( {1 - Q} \right)^{\left\lceil {{\tau  \over k}} \right\rceil }}
\end{split}
\end{equation} 
where $Q = {p_{01}} + {p_{10}}$. Suppose the EH state in the $x$-th slot is known, then the probability of the ON state $p(x)=0$ when the EH state is OFF, otherwise $p(x)=1$ with the ON state. Thus, the Eq. \eqref{eq:P_ON_1} can be expressed as,
\begin{equation} \label{eq:P_ON_2}
p(x+\tau) =\left\{ { \begin{array}{l}
{{{{{p_{01}}} \over Q} - {{{p_{01}}\cdot{{\left( {1 - Q} \right)}^{\left\lceil\frac{\tau}{k}\right\rceil} }} \over Q},{\rm{  }}p\left( {x } \right) = 0}}\\
{{{{{p_{01}}} \over Q} + {{{p_{10}}\cdot{{\left( {1 - Q} \right)}^{\left\lceil\frac{\tau}{k}\right\rceil} }} \over Q},{\rm{  }}p\left( {x } \right) = 1}}
\end{array}}\right.
\end{equation}

Thus, the hub can use the above equation to predict the EH state in each slot of the following superframe, while the last EH state in the allocated slot of the last superframe can be obtained through the feedback from the node.

\subsection{Sensor State Evaluation}
Considering the heterogeneous EH states, the residual energy from energy harvesters is different in different nodes. 
For the energy-sufficient nodes, the residual energy in these nodes is enough to transmit the arriving data in the following superframe. Thus these energy-sufficient nodes are insensitive to the location of allocated slots in the following superframe, while the number of allocated slots becomes important with considering both the arriving data packets and the blocked packets in the data queue. As for the energy-constrained nodes, we need to dynamically adjust the locations of allocated slots to harvest more energy to improve the short-term QoS performance. Therefore, the nodes can be classified into two categories based on the residual energy: the energy-sufficient nodes and the energy-constrained nodes.
\begin{equation} \label{eq:energy_con}
 \textbf{Con1:} \quad {E_{res,i}} \ge \left[ {\left( {1 + \alpha } \right){P_{tx,i}} + {P_{ct,i}}} \right] \cdot {{{S_i} \cdot T} \over R}
\end{equation}
where $E_{res,i}$ denotes the residual energy in node $i$. When the above condition \eqref{eq:energy_con} is satisfied for sensor $i$, the node $i$ is divided into the GOOD node set ${\Phi _{GOOD}}$. Otherwise, the node $i$ belongs to the BAD node set ${\Phi _{BAD}}$.

When allocating the time slots for each node, the nodes in ${\Phi _{BAD}}$, which is sensitive to the locations of allocated slots, should be firstly allocated for the time slots. Then the rest of the nodes are allocated for these nodes in ${\Phi _{GOOD}}$ with considering the blocked packets in the data queue.
\begin{equation} \small
Node_{i} \in \left\{ { \begin{array}{l}
\begin{aligned}
{\Phi _{GOOD}} &, \text{  If \textbf{Con1} is satisfied.} \\
{\Phi _{BAD}} &, \text{ Otherwise}
\end{aligned}
\end{array}}\right. , \forall i \in \mathcal{C}_{node}
\end{equation}


\subsection{Slot Allocation Scheme for Energy-Constrained Nodes}
\begin{figure}[!htb]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{slot_allocation}
\caption{Details of slot allocations for each sensor.}
\label{fig:slot_allocation}
\end{figure}

For the energy-constrained nodes in the BAD set ${\Phi _{BAD}}$, the residual energy is limited to transmit the arriving data in the next framework. Thus, it should harvest more energy before its dedicated slot in the following framework. Generally, the node with the allocated slot at the end of the superframe will have more time to collect energy.
Due to the time-varying and heterogeneous EH states for nodes, there may be several nodes in the BAD set ${\Phi _{BAD}}$, thus we should dynamic allocate the slots for each nodes with considering both the number and the locations.

Firstly, we evaluate how long each sensor will take to harvest enough energy to transmit the arriving data. The probability of the ON state in the last allocated slot can be obtained by the hub through the feedback from the node $i$, which is regard as $p_{i}(0)$. In addition, the probability of the ON state for the following slots can be predicted as the equation \eqref{eq:P_ON_2}. Thus, the total harvesting energy after $m$ slots on average from the last allocated slot is calculated as follows,
\begin{equation}  
F_{i,EH}(m) = {\sum\limits_{l = 1}^m {\left( {{p_i}\left( {r{e_i} + l} \right) \cdot \overline {E{H_i}}  \cdot {t_{slot}}} \right)} }
\end{equation}
where $re_{i}$ is the number of slots from the last allocated slot to the current beacon as shown in Fig. \ref{fig:slot_allocation}. Obviously, the function $F_{i,EH}(m)$ is a monotone function of time. 
Therefore, we can obtain the needed number of slots after the current beacon, called the expected waiting time $\eta_{i}$ for node $i$, to harvest enough energy to transmit the arriving data as the following equation,
\begin{equation} \small
\eta_{i} = \mathop {\arg }\limits_m \left\{ { F_{i,EH}(m)   = \left[ {\left( {1 + \alpha } \right){P_{tx,i}} + {P_{ct,i}}} \right] \cdot {{{S_i} \cdot T} \over R}} \right\}
\end{equation}

For different nodes in ${\Phi _{BAD}}$, the node with the larger expected waiting time $\eta$ means that it needs more time to harvest energy before the next transmissions, thus
it should be allocated the slots after the nodes with the smaller expected waiting time $\eta$.
So the expected waiting time $\eta$ can be used to sort the nodes for allocating slots.

After ordering the nodes, the slot allocation consists of two aspects: the number of slots and the locations of slots. As shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:slot_allocation}, the specific allocated slots for sensor $i$ can be determined by two parameters: $g_{i}$ and $n_{i}$. $g_{i}$ represents the number of slots between the end of allocated slots for previous node and the begin of allocated slots for node $i$, while $n_{i}$ denotes the number of allocated slots for node $i$. 
Finally, the slot allocation problem can be state as: to maximize the difference between the location and the expected waiting time of all nodes for achieving more energy for these energy-constrained nodes by optimizing the number and the locations of slots for each sensor. Mathematically, the problem can be formulated as follows,
\begin{subequations} \label{P3:slot_allocation}
\begin{align}
    \textbf{P3:}& \quad \mathop {\max }\limits_{\small{({g_{i},{n_i}})}} \;  {G_{sum}}\left(\eta_{i},{g_{i},{n_i}} \right), \label{P3:obj} \\
    s.t.\quad & {\sum\limits_{i \in {\Phi _{BAD}}} {\left( {{g_i} + {n_i}} \right) } \le M} , \label{P3:con1} \\
		& R \cdot {n_i} \cdot {t_{slot}} \ge D_{i},\label{P3:con2}\\
    & {{g_i},{n_i} \in {\Bbb N}}, i \in {\Phi _{BAD}}, \label{P3:con3}
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
where ${G_{sum}}$ is the sum distance between the location and the expected waiting time of all nodes as the objective function, which can be expressed as follows,
\begin{equation}\label{math:sum_gain}
\begin{array}{l}
    {G_{sum}}\left(\eta_{i},{g_{i},{n_i}} \right) = \\
    \quad {\sum\limits_{i \in {\Phi _{BAD}}} {\left( {\sum\limits_{\left\{ {j \in {\Phi _{BAD}}|{\eta _j} < {\eta _i}} \right\}} {\left( {{g_j} + {n_j}} \right) + {g_i} - {\eta _i}} } \right)} }.
\end{array}
\end{equation}

In the constraint (\ref{P3:con1}), the number of allocated slots should be less than the total number $M$ of slots in a superframe. As for the constraint (\ref{P3:con2}), the number of allocated slots for each sensor should be able to transmit the arriving data with considering the packet loss rate, where the equivalent arriving data $D_{i}$ for node $i$ can be expressed as follows,
\begin{equation}
D_{i}={{{S_i} \cdot \left( {r{e_i} + \sum\limits_{\left\{ {j \in {\Phi _{BAD}}|{\eta _j} \le {\eta _i}} \right\}} {\left( {{g_j} + {n_j}} \right)} } \right) \cdot {t_{slot}}} \over {\left( {1 - PL{R_{i,th}}} \right)}}
\end{equation}

The slot allocation problem \textbf{P3} is an Integer Linear Programming (ILP), which can be solved efficiently \cite{boyd2004convex}. After allocating slots for the energy-constrained nodes, the remaining slots are then assigned to the energy-sufficient nodes in the GOOD set ${\Phi _{GOOD}}$.

\subsection{Slot Allocation Scheme for Energy-Sufficient Nodes}

Compared with the energy-constrained nodes, the energy-sufficient nodes have enough energy to transmit the arriving data, and they are insensitive to the locations of allocated slots. 
Considering the time-varying EH states, some data packets may be blocked in the data queue with the dynamic link quality. If the blocked data packets cannot be transmitted to the hub, they will lead to the increasing delay of not only the blocked packets but also the arriving packets \cite{liu2017buffer}. Therefore, the blocked data packets in the data queue need to be transmitted for improving the short-term QoS performance, when there are sufficient residual energy in the energy buffer. 

Considering both the blocked data ${D_{block}}$ in the data queue and the arriving data in the following superframe, the total data ${D_{buf}}$ can be expressed as follows,
\begin{equation}
{D_{buf,i}} = {D_{block,i}} + {S_i} \cdot T
\end{equation}

The remaining number of slots ${N_{rest}}$ after the slot allocation for energy-constrained nodes can be calculated as follows,
\begin{equation}
{{N_{rest}} = M - \sum\limits_{i \in {\Phi _{BAD}}} {{n_i}}}
\end{equation}

Thus, the total number of the allocated slots for the energy-sufficient nodes should be not larger than the remaining number of slots ${N_{rest}}$, given as follows,
\begin{equation}
\sum\limits_{i \in {\Phi _{GOOD}}}^{} {{n_i} \leqslant {N_{rest}}}
\end{equation}

For different energy-sufficient nodes, they expect to be allocated enough slots for transmitting both the blocked data and the arriving data. However, there should be enough energy for supporting the transmission in the energy buffer, as satisfying the following constraints,
\begin{equation}
{{E_{res,i}} + \overline {E{H_i}}  \cdot T \geqslant \left[ {\left( {1 + \alpha } \right){P_{tx,i}} + {P_{ct,i}}} \right] \cdot {n_i} \cdot {t_{slot}}}
\end{equation}

To evaluate the satisfaction of both the blocked data and the arriving data with given number of slots, a utility function $U(m,D_{buf})$ is defined as follows,  
\begin{equation} \label{eq:utility}  \footnotesize
U(m,D_{buf}) = \frac{{\left( {{(R\cdot m \cdot t_{slot})^2} - 2 \cdot (R\cdot m \cdot t_{slot}) \cdot D_{buf}  } \right)}}{{D_{buf}^2}}
\end{equation}
When the number of allocated slots is less than $\frac{D_{buf}}{R \cdot t_{slot}}$, more allocated slots can achieve a higher utility to transmit more data in the queue buffer. When the number of the allocated slots reaches the value $\frac{D_{buf}}{R \cdot t_{slot}}$, the node obtain the highest utility. If still increasing the number of allocated slots, it will cause the waste of the channel resources, thus the utility will decrease correspondingly.
Finally, the slot allocation problem for the energy-sufficient nodes can be formulated to maximize the total utility of all nodes in GOOD set, subject to the total slot constraint and the energy constraint. Mathematically, the slot optimization problem can be written as follows,
\begin{subequations} \label{P4:slot_allocation} \small
\begin{align}
    \textbf{P4:}& \quad \mathop {\max }\limits_{\small{({{n_i}})}} \;  \sum\limits_{i \in {\Phi _{GOOD}}} {U\left( {{n_i} ,{D_{buf,i}}} \right)} , \label{P4:obj} \\
    s.t.\quad & {\sum\limits_{i \in {\Phi _{GOOD}}}^{} {{n_i} \leqslant {N_{rest}}}} , \label{P4:con1} \\
		& {{E_{res,i}} + \overline {E{H_i}}  \cdot T \geqslant \left[ {\left( {1 + \alpha } \right){P_{tx,i}} + {P_{ct,i}}} \right] \cdot {n_i} \cdot {t_{slot}}},\label{P4:con2}\\
    & {{n_i} \in {\Bbb N}}, i \in {\Phi _{GOOD}}, \label{P4:con3}
\end{align}
\end{subequations}

With respect to \textbf{P4}, the problem is a classical Quadratic Problem (QP), which can also be solve efficiently with using many custom solvers \cite{lofberg2004yalmip}.

\section{Simulation results} \label{sec:simulation}
In this section, we investigate the performance of the proposed Power-Rate-Slot resource allocation scheme in terms of average PLR, packet delay, throughput and energy efficiency.
To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms, there are three comparison schemes: the offline scheme \cite{huang2014optimal}, the online scheme \cite{ibarra2016qos} and the fixed scheme.
Due to the lack of the IEEE 802.15.6-based hardware, we develop an event-driven WBAN system in the MATLAB. An MATLAB-based optimization toolbox, YALMIP \cite{lofberg2004yalmip}, is embedded in the simulation environment to solve the proposed optimization problems. To better simulate the channel, the channel reference code by IEEE 802.15.6 standard \cite{yazdandoost2009channel} is adopted as the channel module in the WBAN system.

\subsection{Simulation Setup}
Above all, the WBAN simulation settings should be illustrated in details. We consider a classical WBAN system, which contains one hub and five $N=5$ wireless body nodes. The deployed positions and link parameters of all nodes are given in Table \ref{tab:posNode}, referring to the actual link experiment results in \cite{d2010statistical} \cite{reusens2009characterization}. The changes of postures are modeled as a Markov chain, and we only consider three most common postures, i.e., still, walk and run with 0.5, 0.3 and 0.2 steady-state probabilities, correspondingly. Besides, we assume the hub can identify the changes of postures with high accuracy in real-time \cite{guo2016two}. The extension to more body postures is straightforward. The standard derivation $\sigma_{s}$ of the shadowing changes with the postures, while the mean of the shadowing can be used to indicate the quality of the environment \cite{d2010statistical}. In this paper, we assume the hub has sufficient energy supply, while the body nodes are powered by a piezoelectric energy harvester according to the intensity of body movements. Considering the different intensity of body parts, the energy harvesting rates of different body nodes are heterogeneous, which also change with the postures, as well as the steady state probabilities of the EH states \cite{ibarra2016qos}, as shown in Table \ref{tab:parEH}. Other parameters are selected according to the IEEE 802.15.6 specifications \cite{ieee2012WBAN}.

\subsection{The Effectiveness of Long-term Power-Rate Control Scheme}

Firstly, we analyze the allocated results of the long-term power-rate control scheme (PRCS) for different postures. As shown in Table \ref{tab:posNode}, the parameters of the path loss are different to different nodes as well as the source rate, meanwhile the statistical characterizations of the shadowing fluctuate for different postures.
Thus, the resource allocation schemes should be able to deal with the dynamic link quality. 
The allocated transmission power and configured source rates for different nodes by the proposed PRCS in different postures are given in Figure \ref{fig:PRCS}. 
In the PRCS, we optimize the transmission power for each nodes based on the link quality to support the long-term QoS performance. Thus, the allocated transmission powers for each nodes are dynamically adjusted when the link quality changes due to the postures in Figure \ref{fig:PRCS_power}. For instance, the node 3 and the node 4 are close to the hub, and their link qualities are much better than the other nodes. Hence, the transmission powers for them are assigned a lower value to save precious energy under the condition of satisfying the long-term QoS requirements. 

In addition, the source rates for different nodes are configured based on the heterogeneous requirements and the energy harvesting rates.  As shown in Figure \ref{fig:PRCS_rate}, the source rates of the node 1 and the node 2 are configured as the low boundary $S_{low}$ in all postures. This is because the highest energy harvesting rates of them are still not enough for supporting the optimal source rate $S_{up}$ with the higher transmission power in Figure \ref{fig:PRCS_power}. As for node 5, the energy harvesting rates in different postures are different for the piezoelectric energy harvester in Table \ref{tab:parEH}. Thus, the source rates are configured, correspondingly.

\end{figure}



\subsection{The Effectiveness of Short-term QoS Aware Slot Allocation Scheme}
Secondly, we evaluate the effectiveness of the short-term QoS aware slot allocation scheme (QASAS). Considering the dynamic link qualities, the packet losses will occur with uncertainty. Besides, the arriving energy in a superframe is also random, thus the number of the blocked packets cannot be predicted. If the blocked packets cannot be transmitted to the hub, not only the blocked packets but also the arriving packets will have a high packet delay, and even it will cause the packet losses due to the packet delay over the preset threshold or the packet buffer overflow.

Compared with the long-term PRCS, the short-term QASAS can give a timely response to the changes of the packet buffer state and the energy buffer state. When there are many blocked packets in the packet buffer and residual energy in the energy buffer, more slots will be allocated for transmitting the blocked packets based on the level of the residual energy. As shown in Figure \ref{fig:cp_packets_without_slot}, the number of packets keeps at a high level without using the QASAS. Fortunately, the QASAS can timely transmit the blocked packets based on the packet buffer state and the energy buffer state, hence, the number of the packet buffer can stay a low level as shown in Figure \ref{fig:cp_packets_with_slot}.

%Thus, the short-term QoS performance can be improved if the blocked packets can be .

\subsection{The Influence of Different Mean of Shadowing on Performance}
%\subsection{Simulation Results of Power-Rate-Slot Control Schemes}
For evaluating the effectiveness of the long-term power-rate control scheme and the short-term slot allocation scheme, we compare them with three comparison schemes: the offline scheme \cite{huang2014optimal}, the online scheme \cite{ibarra2016qos} and the fixed scheme in terms of the average PLR, packet delay, throughput and energy per bit. For simulating the impact of the changes in the environment on the QoS performance, the mean of the shadowing can be adjusted to change the statistical characterization of the wireless channel. The higher mean of the shadowing represents the worse link quality of the wireless channel. In this paper, we assume all nodes have the same mean of the shadowing for the sake of simplification, and study the influence of the mean of the shadowing on the QoS performance. 

As shown in Figure \ref{fig:cp_PLR} and Figure \ref{fig:cp_delay}, the proposed PRS-RA scheme obtains the lowest PLR performance and the lowest packet delay which satisfying the QoS requirements, even comparing with the offline scheme. This is because the proposed PRS-RA scheme considers both the long-term QoS performance and the short-term QoS performance though the adaption of the source rate, the transmission power and the slots. 
However, due to the priori knowledge of the channel state and EH states, the offline scheme can optimally allocated the transmission power to maximize the throughput as shown in Figure \ref{fig:cp_Throughput}. In addition, the transmission power is adjusted in real-time based on the real-time path loss of the channel, thus the energy efficiency is the highest as shown in Figure \ref{fig:cp_energyPerBit}. 
Meanwhile, both the proposed PRS-RA scheme and online scheme assume that only the statistical information of channel state and the EH states are priori known by the hub. However, the proposed PRS-RA scheme has a higher energy efficiency performance than the online scheme, which is very close to the offline scheme. This is because the optimal transmission power is firstly allocated to support the long-term QoS performance, and then the effective slot allocation can further guarantee there is enough power to transmit the data packets in the allocated slots, which can avoid the waste of energy due to the packet losses. 

As for the throughput in Figure \ref{fig:cp_Throughput}, the throughput of the proposed PRS-RA scheme decreases with the mean of the shadowing, while the energy cost per bit increases with the mean of the shadowing in Figure \ref{fig:cp_energyPerBit}. When the link quality becomes worse with a higher mean of the shadowing, the long-term power-rate control scheme (PRCS) dynamically adjust the transmission rate and the source rate based on the link quality. Generally, the transmission power will be increased to guarantee the QoS performance and the source rate will be decreased to ensure the integrity of data with a lower PLR. In addition, the short-term QoS aware slot allocation scheme (QASAS) dynamically analyzes the state of each nodes, and then optimizes the appropriate slots to copy with the blocked packets in the buffer. Hence, the bandwidth utilization of the proposed PRA-SA reaches to 94\%, which is higher than the online scheme, thus, more channel resource can be utilized by other WBANs.

To evaluate the effectiveness of the long-term power-rate control scheme (PRCS) and the short-term QoS aware slot allocation scheme (QASAS), we compare three different schemes: 1) the proposed PRS-RA with both PRCS and QASAS, 2) the proposed PRS-RA only with PRCS, 3) the proposed PRS-RA only with QASAS. And we gradually change EH efficiency ratio for all nodes to scale the range of the energy harvesting rate $[EH_{min},EH_{max}]$. The smaller EH efficiency ratio means energy harvester can collect less energy when the energy harvester stays the ON state. The QoS performances versus the EH efficiency ratio are given in Figure \ref{fig:cp_EHefficiency}.

The nodes can collect more energy with a higher EH efficiency ratio, thus the average PLRs of all three schemes decrease with the EH efficiency ratio as shown in Figure \ref{fig:EHefficiency_PLR}. And the PRS-RA with both PRCS and QASAS outperform the other schemes, and it can achieve almost 0\% PLR performance. In addition, the PRS-RA with only PRCS has a lower PLR than the PRS-RA with only QASAS, this is because the optimization allocation of the transmission power and the source rate can support the long-term QoS performance, while the PRS-RA with only QASAS can adjust the number of slots for each nodes, which cannot deal with the packet losses due to the dynamic links with a fixed transmission power. However, when the short-term QASAS combines with the long-term PRCS, not only the PLR but also the packet delay can achieve the best performance. Though the PRS-RA with only QASAS can have a highest throughput in Figure \ref{fig:EHefficiency_Throughput} and a highest bandwidth utilization in Figure \ref{fig:EHefficiency_bandwidth}, the highest PLR in Figure \ref{fig:EHefficiency_PLR} will cost a lot of energy cost, which cannot be acceptable especially for the EH-powered WBAN system.

%%%According to the reusing rules of the ESM, the distance among EH-DPs reusing the same spectrum of one CU is enough far away from each other. Hence, the interference among EH-DPs can be approximately ignored. Based on this, the minimum reusing radius $d_{EH}$ is approximately determined by the CU and the EH-DP reusing the same spectrum resource. Hence, according to the transmission rate requirement, the matched CU $c_i$ and EH-DP $d_j$ must satisfy the following constraints:

% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/ifpdf
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of the IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 5.0 (2009-03-20) and later if using hyperref.sty.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/cite
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.

\begin{abstract}
 
Wireless body area network (WBAN) has become a promising network for continuous health monitoring of various diseases. 
The limited energy of sensors in WBAN cannot support the long term work with the high requirements of Quality of Service (QoS) for health applications. 
Energy harvesting (EH)-powered WBAN, which can provide uninterrupted work, has attracted more attention from both macadamia and industry. 
However, the time-varying and heterogeneous EH states of different sensors  become an important factor when designing the resource allocation schemes in EH-powered WBAN.
In this paper, we propose a novel two-phase resource allocation scheme, which optimizes the allocation of transmission power, source rate and slots to improve the QoS performance of EH-powered WBAN. In the first phase, we analysis the relationship between the QoS performance and the source rate for satisfying the Energy Neutral Operation (ENO), and then a joint Power-Rate Control Scheme (PRCS) is proposed to optimize the source rate and transmission power for ensuring the long-term QoS performance based on the statistical properties of EH. 
Moreover, we design a QoS Aware Slot Allocation Scheme (QASAS) to dynamically adjust the time slot allocation to cope with the time-varying EH states for obtaining better short-term QoS performance in the second phase.
Finally, numerical simulation results demonstrate that the proposed joint Power-Rate-Slot resource allocation of EH-powered WBAN can effectively exploit the time-varying EH to improve both long-term and short-term QoS performance, and .

%%%In this study, we investigate the resource allocation schemes in terms of the spectrum resource matching and the power allocation under a single EH-DCCN. In the EH-DCCN, D2D pairs powered by EH module are allowed to reuse the CUs' uplink spectrum resource to transmit their local data. Thus, the key contributions of this paper can be expressed as three aspects:

%%%In this scenario, each EH-DP uses the harvested energy to transmit their local data. For the $d_j$-th EH-DP, $E_{d_j}^t$ units of energy can be harvested in the $t$-th time slot where $E_{d_j}^t \ge 0$. $\left\{ {E_{{d_j}}^1,E_{{d_j}}^2, \ldots ,E_{{d_j}}^t, \ldots ,E_{{d_j}}^T} \right\}$ is the time sequence of harvested energy in $T$ time slots.

\section{Simulation results} \label{sec:simulation_results}
In this section, the performance of the two proposed algorithms and the characteristics of the EH-DCCN are investigated in the performance of the average achievable system rate and the matching probability of EH-DPs. The matching probability of EH-DPs represents the ratio of the matched EH-DPs in $N_D$.

\section{proof of \textbf{corollary \ref{thm:1}}}
According to the reusing rules of the ESM, the distance among EH-DPs reusing the same spectrum of one CU is enough far away from each other. Hence, the interference among EH-DPs can be approximately ignored. Based on this, the minimum reusing radius $d_{EH}$ is approximately determined by the CU and the EH-DP reusing the same spectrum resource. Hence, according to the transmission rate requirement, the matched CU $c_i$ and EH-DP $d_j$ must satisfy the following constraints:
